    Problem to Solve
According to Scholastic, E.B. White's Charlotte's Web is between a second- and fourth-grade reading level, and Lois 
Lowry's The Giver is between an eighth- and twelfth-grade reading level. What does it mean, though, for a book to 
be at a particular reading level?

Well, in many cases, a human expert might read a book and make a decision on the grade (i.e., year in school) for 
which they think the book is most appropriate. But an algorithm could likely figure that out too!

In a file called readability.c in a folder called readability, you'll implement a program that calculates the 
approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text. Your program should print as output “Grade X” where “X” is 
the grade level computed, rounded to the nearest integer. If the grade level is 16 or higher (equivalent to or 
greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output “Grade 16+” instead of giving the 
exact index number. If the grade level is less than 1, your program should output “Before Grade 1”.

    Background
So what sorts of traits are characteristic of higher reading levels? Well, longer words probably correlate with 
higher reading levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too.

A number of “readability tests” have been developed over the years that define formulas for computing the reading 
level of a text. One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed 
to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text. The formula is

index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
